It seems that this is due to a wonderful article written by James Somers for the technology section of the online magazine, theAtlantic, which presented Project Euler in a very positive light:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/06/how-i-failed-failed-and-finally-succeeded-at-learning-how-to-code/239855/\">How I Failed, Failed, and Finally Succeeded at Learning How to Code</a></p>\n<p>Obviously we could only be very grateful to James Somers for writing the article as it has clearly attracted a large number of new members. However, the downside was that the website began to strain under the load which is why you will have noted the problems in navigating the website.</p>\n<p>Our hosts have worked to help us with this, but as a temporary measure I have also removed the feature which displays the number of users currently online, which was regularly showing figures over 200 during the past couple of days. The result is that we are almost back to normal speeds. With a rethink in the way it is implemented I hope to be able to re-enable the \"users online\" feature in the future.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the Project Euler team would like to thank James Somers for his article and we would like to extend a very special welcome to any new members who have joined us recently.</p></p> \n(Tuesday 07 June 2011: Recent Article)"],"link":["http://projecteuler.net/rss_display.php?ref=news&id=29"]},{"guid":["http://projecteuler.net/rss_display.php?ref=problem&id=341"],"pubDate":["Sun, 05 Jun 2011 10:00:00 GMT"],"title":["Problem 341"],"description":["Release date: Sun, 05 Jun 2011 10:00:00 GMT"],"link":["http://projecteuler.net/rss_display.php?ref=problem&id=341"]},{"guid":["http://projecteuler.net/rss_display.php?ref=problem&id=340"],"pubDate":["Sun, 29 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT"],"title":["Problem 340"],"description":["Release date: Sun, 29 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT"],"link":["http://projecteuler.net/rss_display.php?ref=problem&id=340"]},{"guid":["http://projecteuler.net/rss_display.php?ref=problem&id=339"],"pubDate":["Sun, 22 May 2011 04:00:00 GMT"],"title":["Problem 339"],"description":["Release date: Sun, 22 May 2011 04:00:00 GMT"],"link":["http://projecteuler.net/rss_display.php?ref=problem&id=339"]},{"guid":["http://projecteuler.net/rss_display.php?ref=problem&id=338"],"pubDate":["Sun, 15 May 2011 01:00:00 GMT"],"title":["Problem 338"],"description":["Release date: Sun, 15 May 2011 01:00:00 GMT"],"link":["http://projecteuler.net/rss_display.php?ref=problem&id=338"]},{"guid":["http://projecteuler.net/rss_display.php?ref=problem&id=337"],"pubDate":["Sat, 07 May 2011 22:00:00 GMT"],"title":["Problem 337"],"description":["Release date: Sat, 07 May 2011 22:00:00 GMT"],"link":["http://projecteuler.net/rss_display.php?ref=problem&id=337"]},{"guid":["http://projecteuler.net/rss_display.php?ref=problem&id=336"],"pubDate":["Sat, 30 Apr 2011 19:00:00 GMT"],"title":["Problem 336"],"description":["Release date: Sat, 30 Apr 2011 19:00:00 GMT"],"link":["http://projecteuler.net/rss_display.php?ref=problem&id=336"]},{"guid":["http://projecteuler.net/rss_display.php?ref=problem&id=335"],"pubDate":["Sat, 23 Apr 2011 16:00:00 GMT"],"title":["Problem 335"],"description":["Release date: Sat, 23 Apr 2011 16:00:00 GMT"],"link":["http://projecteuler.net/rss_display.php?ref=problem&id=335"]},{"guid":["http://projecteuler.net/rss_display.php?ref=problem&id=334"],"pubDate":["Sat, 23 Apr 2011 16:00:00 GMT"],"title":["Problem 334"],"description":["Release date: Sat, 23 Apr 2011 16:00:00 GMT"],"link":["http://projecteuler.net/rss_display.php?ref=problem&id=334"]}],"lastBuildDate":["Fri, 10 Jun 2011 09:06:37 GMT"]}],"xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"}
